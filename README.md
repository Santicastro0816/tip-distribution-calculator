# This is just an example
## Subtitle 2
### Subtitle 3
this is just a way of trying to explain what each week is doing on my learning in Canada.  

**This is a bold text** using `**` at start or end.  

_this is a italic text_ using `_` at start and end.  

~~this is a trikethrough text~~ using `~~` at start and end.  

**we can also do bold with nested _italic_**.  

***or we can do all bold and italic*** using `***`.   

we can do <sub>subscript</sub> text similar to using html tag `<sub>`.  

or a <sup>superscript</sup> the exact same wat, with a `<sup>` tag.  

we can also <ins>underline</ins> things with a html tag `<ins>`.  


We can also quote text with `>`.  

>This is a quote


can coute code using " ` `" like `git status` or `print("Hello World")`     

we can use links when they are inside parenthesis like this [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) `[linked text](link)`.  

it dosent matter how many lines are between text. we have to add two spaces and then press enter to start a new line in readmes.    

now here is a way to link the heading of the read me file:

# Example headings

## Sample Section

## This'll be a _Helpful_ Section About the Greek Letter Θ!
A heading containing characters not allowed in fragments, UTF-8 characters, two consecutive spaces between the first and second words, and formatting.

## This heading is not unique in the file

TEXT 1 













            

## This heading is not unique in the file

TEXT 2  














               

# Links to the example headings above

Link to the sample section: [Link Text](#sample-section).

Link to the helpful section: [Link Text](#thisll-be-a-helpful-section-about-the-greek-letter-Θ).

Link to the first non-unique section: [Link Text](#this-heading-is-not-unique-in-the-file).

Link to the second non-unique section: [Link Text](#this-heading-is-not-unique-in-the-file-1).
